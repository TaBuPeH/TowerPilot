"""Fleet sighting by SHAPE + COLOUR (no templates, no shipped art).

A fleet is ONE big outlined pentagon of a random type (user, 2026-10-17/18):
saboteur red, commander orange, overcharge blue-violet. It arrives with a
swarm of pale Scatter triangles (same hue as overcharge, desaturated glow)
that do the killing - those are NOT the fleet and are not counted here. The
triangles that share a hue (vampire = saboteur red, scatter = overcharge) and
the red/orange/yellow squares (basic, tank, fast) are ordinary enemies; five
sides AND a large area is what makes a blob the fleet. Live T15 sightings
(2026-10-18) measured the fleet pentagon's outline at 1848-1882 px against
<= 582 for any ordinary pentagon.

Hues are the OpenCV hue (0-180) medians of the opaque saturated pixels of the
installed game's own sprites (measured 2026-10-17 from the local APK
extraction: saboteur 177, commander 15, overcharge 127). Nothing here is read
from, or written to, a template file.

`scan(frame)` -> {type: pentagon_count} over the field ROI, side menu
excluded. The Nuke gate in orchestrator.py decides what a count means.
